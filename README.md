Scranular
=========

The start of my granular synthesizer programmed in scala. The language
was chosen partly as a learning experience, and partly because I'm interested
in the efficiency and dsp capabilities of the jvm but didn't feel like writing Java.

Future plans include saving the output to a file, other grain types(FM,Osc).
More input options and a gui.

Building
--------

To build make sure that your `JAVA_HOME` and `SCALA_HOME` environment
variables are set. Then run ant from the root directory.

Running
-------

Granulator <File Name>

Currently I have only tested with .wav files.
