The start of my granular synthesizer programmed in scala. The language was chosen partly as a learning experience, and partly because I'm interested in the efficiency and dsp capabilities of the jvm but didn't feel like writing in java.

Currently it has input output capabilities, but the synthesis part isn't implemented.

Future plans include saving the output to a file, and possible a vst version if time allows. This would serve as a proof of concept that a vst can be programmed and run efficiently on the jvm. Some parts may need to be writtin using the JNI, but I will save that hurdle for later. 

To build make sure that your JAVA_HOME and SCALA_HOME environment variables are set. Then run ant from the root directory.

To run from command line:

Granulator <File Name>

Currently I have only tested with .wav files.
